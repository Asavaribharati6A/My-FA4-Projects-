Ancient India was home to renowned centers of learning, such as Nalanda and Takshashila.</p>

    <li><u>Climate</u></li>

<p>Ancient India, just like modern India, had a climate that varied with the seasons. Although mostly warm and wet, Ancient India had hot and dry, hot and wet, and cool and dry seasons. Ancient India experienced a diverse range of climates, including tropical, subtropical, and arid regions. The countryâ€™s geography, with its varied topography and proximity to the Himalayas, contributed to this climatic diversity.

This climate variability influenced agricultural practices, trade routes, and the overall development of ancient Indian civilizations.</p>
